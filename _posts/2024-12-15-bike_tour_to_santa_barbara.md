December 8 - 13, 2024 I took my first sizeable solo bike tour from Livermore to Santa Luis Obispo and eventually to Santa Barbara, CA.  The trip totalled 240 miles and over 10K feet of elevation.  Here are links to a more detailed ride report of my trip as well as a mapped collection of my GPS logs.
