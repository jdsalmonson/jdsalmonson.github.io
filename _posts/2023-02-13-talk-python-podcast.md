It was a pleasure and honor to be a guest on the [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) podcast to discuss my work building Python tools and libraries in support of recent breakthrough ignition experiments at the [NIF](https://lasers.llnl.gov/).  Both audio and video versions of the podcast are available [here](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/403/fusion-ignition-breakthrough-and-python).
