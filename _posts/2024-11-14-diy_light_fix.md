The plastic clasps that hold the cover for my daughter's closet light disintigrated.  I was loathe to replace the entire fixture because of the failure of such a minor part, so I decided to give my nascent CAD and 3D printing skills a whirl to see if I could make a drop-in replacement for these clasps.  It turned out to be relatively straightforward to do, which was gratifying.  Since this was a conveniently compact and self-contained project, I decided to make it into a short-format DIY video.
